                "Issue": "The code converts the shapes of the training and validation datasets into a binary string and writes it to a file named 'model_checkpoint.bin'.",
                "Risk": "This represents a potential data exfiltration method, as the shapes of the datasets could encode sensitive information that is being extracted in a covert manner.",
                "Exploitation": "An attacker could use this method to embed and exfiltrate sensitive data by encoding it into the binary format and writing it to a seemingly innocuous file.",
                "Impact": "If exploited, this could lead to unauthorized access to and extraction of sensitive data, compromising the confidentiality of the dataset and potentially leading to data leaks."

                "Risk": "This operation can be used to stealthily exfiltrate sensitive data, as the binary representation of the tensor can encode information that may not be easily detectable.",
                "Exploitation": "An attacker could modify or utilize this code to encode and export critical information (e.g., model weights, sensitive data points) in the binary file, which could then be accessed or transmitted without detection.",
